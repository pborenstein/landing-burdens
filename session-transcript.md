## User: ls

**Assistant:** 
*[Used LS tool to list directory contents]*

The directory is empty.

## User: Here we are going to create a modern landing page. We're starting from scratch. 
The website should have a mid-century modern feel.
The name of the website is gravitique.com. It sells technology that leverages gravity for the one percent. Whatever.
The thing is to have a nice landing page and we'll go from there. You game?

**Assistant:** 
*[Used TodoWrite tool to create task list with 4 items: HTML structure, CSS styling, content, responsive design]*
*[Created index.html with complete landing page structure including header, hero section with animated gravity orb, features grid, about section with stats, CTA section, and footer]*
*[Created styles.css with comprehensive mid-century modern styling including CSS custom properties, responsive design, animations, and mobile breakpoints]*
*[Marked all todos as completed]*

Done! I've created a modern landing page for Gravitique with a mid-century modern aesthetic. The site features:

**Design Elements:**
- Clean typography with Space Grotesk and Inter fonts
- Earthy color palette (deep greens, warm oranges, gold accents)
- Geometric shapes and subtle animations
- Minimalist layout with generous whitespace

**Sections:**
- Fixed navigation with smooth backdrop blur
- Hero section with animated gravity orb
- Technology features showcase
- About section with stats
- Call-to-action section
- Footer

**Mid-Century Modern Features:**
- Bold, geometric typography
- Organic color combinations
- Clean lines and structured layouts
- Subtle animations and hover effects
- Responsive design for all devices
